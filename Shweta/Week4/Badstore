Q7. What is the key of the cookie used for the cart?
A7. CartID
    (1529143818%3A1%3A12.5%3A1003)

Q8. BadStore's session cookie format is poorly designed because it is uses a predictable structure. In particular, it is an encoded string (with a URL-encoded newline at the end) of the form XXX:YYY:ZZZ:U. What are the XXX, YYY, and ZZZ portions of this string?
A8. The decoded string of the cookie : abc@xyz.com:900150983cd24fb0d6963f7d28e17f72:abc:U
    XXX: email, YYY: MD5 Hash of the password, ZZZ: name, U:role(i.e user)

Q9. BadStore's cart cookie is also an encoded string with a predictable structure XXX:YYY:... etc., and it probably contains information it shouldn't. Which field of the decoded string could an attacker change to give himself a discount on an item's price?
A9. The decoded string of the CartId cookie: 1529143818:1:12.5:1003
    Since here the 3rd field is the price of the item selected, that can be changed to give a discount on the item.
    Thus, answer is 3.
