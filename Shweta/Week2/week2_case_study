Case study :
1.
By adding firewalls to prevemt incoming ICMP packets, the system's performance is degraded because it's a demanding task to examine every packet of data.
Also while using the SYN Cookies, the server reject all the TCP optins, thus it is not compatible with TCP.
So, the newer TCP Cookie Transactions (TCPCT) standard is designed to overcome these shortcomings of SYN cookies. 

2.
Along with SYN Cookies, RST Cookies can also be used.Here, the server sends back an incorrect SYN+ACK packet back to client. If the client is legitimate, they should respond with a reset packet and can continue connecting.
Besides, network firewalls, web application firewalls, and load balancers can be used to defend against application-layer attacks (such as Slowloris).
