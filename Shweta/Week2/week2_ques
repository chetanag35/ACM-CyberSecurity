Firewalls can be used to stop simple DoS attacks by blocking all traffic coming from an attacker by identifying his IP.
All messages entering or leaving the intranet pass through the firewall, which examines each message and blocks those that do not meet the specified security criteria.

2.
A Trojan Horse uses the userâ€™s computer as part of the Botnet when performing distributed denial of service attacks.
Therefore by preventing Trojan Horse attacks, DoS attacks can also be prevented.

3.
SYN attack works by flooding the victim with incomplete SYN messages. This causes the user's computer to allocate memory resources that are never used.
Methods for protecting against SYN flood attacks :
1) SYN Cookies :It sends a cookie with its SYN+ACK packet and if a matching cookie is returned with ACK packet from the client, it will establish a complete connection.
2) RST Cookies :The server sends back an incorrect SYN+ACK packet back to client. If the client is legitimate, they should respond with a reset packet and can continue connecting.
3) Stack Tweaking : Here, administrators can tweak TCP stacks to mitigate the effect of SYN flood attacks. Being a complicated method, it is not used much.
