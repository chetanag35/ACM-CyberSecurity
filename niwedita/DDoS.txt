MELBOURNE IT DDoS ATTACK

 Australian domain name registrar Melbourne IT confirmed on 13th April 2017 afternoon that it had experienced a large distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack on its DNS servers that disrupted its web hosting, email platforms, and access to the company’s customer administration portal.Attack impacted a large number of its customers.
 The DNS outage affected Melbourne IT and subsidiaries Netregistry and TPP Wholesale, with DDoS attack bringing down the company’s TheConsole, cPanel, Cloud Hosting, and Mail platforms services.

Ways to defend such attack:
~ Company should have Cloud Mitigation providers. These providers have much more bandwidth than an enterprise could provision on its own to stop the biggest volumetric attacks. They  take advantage of multiple technologies, both commercial off the shelf (COTS) and their own proprietary technology to defend against attacks.


CASE STUDY

1) Using a mitigation partner with firewall: The service was based upon BGP route advertisement and attack monitoring. Once an attack had been identified the mitigation partner advertises your route to pass through their network, where core routers are used to filter out the malicious traffic prior to passing on to the organisation.  

2) Trojan Horses often install a backdoor, allowing for remote access of the infected machine. This allows an attacker to perform various criminal tasks including use of the machine as a zombie within a botnet to perform distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. It is estimated that 15% of Trojan Horse-infected machines being members of botnets around the world,  thus protection against Trojans will definitely reduce DDoS attacks.

3) Methods to prevent SYN flood attacks:
1.SYN Cookies
2.RST Cookies
3.Stack tweaking
