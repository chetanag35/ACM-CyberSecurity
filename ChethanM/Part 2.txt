Part 2

case 1: Runa has configured the firewall to completely block all the icmp packages. This is not right. Although many ddos attacks like ping of death,Smurf attack etc,it has many important features; some are useful for troubleshooting, while some are essential for a network to function correctly.some of the functions which must be allowed are
echo request (as long as it's from our system)and echo reply(as long as it's from the internet)
Fragmentation required/packet too large: these are required for proper tcp working(MTU adjustment), without which data would be silently lost.
traceroute : it allows us to troubleshoot network connection errors between two hosts(by sending time limit exceeded message).
All these should be allowed given that they do not exceed certain limit. Firewall should be configured to block for example more than 3000 pings are received.
case 2

As evident using SYN cookies can lead to SYN flood attack. To prevent this some work around can be implemented if a lot of syn ack packets are not received. Then the sending IP can be located,if it's been spoofed then it can be blocked .
